Package credis as subproject?  Compiled statically?

create_unique_slug should take multibyte characters
  - current behavior technically works with MB input...
    resulting ID may be unexpected, but it will be a
	valid and unique URI

Implement at least one basic caching mechanism
- Requires adding build time into config.h for 
  fixed URIs like / and /version
  ... or, just hard-code with API version parts

Implement sample apache vhost include, nicely commented, 
	also one with authentication

Find portable alternative to pgrep in unit tests

implement secure flag in POST, generates numeric ID to 
keep sensitive information out of ID

Add configure.ac checks for all test programs: pgrep,
redis-cli, xsltproc

Unit tests that validate the XHTML should use xsltproc

Improved error handling for 500, at least send back the redis
error code

Determine if need to detect proxy use in request ... will Apache
fork() an API process if request has full URI?

handle error from fread

todo text should be entity-escaped in output ... < -> &lt;

Add feature test macros

td client should test version

/ contains link to source on github, for Affero compliance

Improve README for general consumption

ensure_redis_connection should fail_with_code
