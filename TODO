Package credis as subproject?  Compiled statically?

create_unique_slug should take multibyte characters
  - current behavior technically works with MB input...
    resulting ID may be unexpected, but it will be a
	valid and unique URI

Implement HEAD for all URIs, as per RFC 3875

Implement at least one basic caching mechanism
- Requires adding build time into config.h for 
  fixed URIs like / and /version
  ... or, just hard-code with API version parts

Support hosting in sub-path.  May require stripping off 
  first n characters of REQUEST_URI, as specified by a
  parameter to 'configure'

Implement a sample client with bash/curl

Implement sample apache vhost include, nicely commented

Find portable alternative to pgrep in unit tests
