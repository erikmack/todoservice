create_unique_slug should take multibyte characters
  - current behavior technically works with MB input...
    resulting ID may be unexpected, but it will be a
	valid and unique URI

Implement at least one basic caching mechanism
- Requires adding build time into config.h for 
  fixed URIs like / and /version
  ... or, just hard-code with API version parts

Add configure.ac checks for all test programs: pgrep,
redis-cli, xsltproc

Unit tests that validate the XHTML should use xsltproc

Improved error handling for 500, at least send back the redis
error code

Add unit tests for 500, try using corrupted data (mismatch ids with members)

Determine if need to detect proxy use in request ... will Apache
fork() an API process if request has full URI?

handle error from fread

todo text should be entity-escaped in output ... < -> &lt;

Add feature test macros

td client should test version
td client should request /todos list following a post
td client should "join" final args, so that quotes aren't required for PUT/POST
bash-completion for td client
td client should fail in a friendlier way

ensure_redis_connection should fail_with_code

configure script informs about credis dependency
