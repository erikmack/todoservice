Package credis as subproject?  Compiled statically?

create_unique_slug should take multibyte characters
  - current behavior technically works with MB input...
    resulting ID may be unexpected, but it will be a
	valid and unique URI

Implement HEAD for all URIs, as per RFC 3875

Implement at least one basic caching mechanism
- Requires adding build time into config.h for 
  fixed URIs like / and /version
  ... or, just hard-code with API version parts

Implement a sample client with bash/curl

Implement sample apache vhost include, nicely commented, 
	also one with authentication

Find portable alternative to pgrep in unit tests

implement secure flag in POST, generates numeric ID to 
keep sensitive information out of ID

Add configure.ac checks for all test programs: pgrep,
redis-cli

Unit tests that validate the XHTML should use an XPath tool
not grep ... this is important for API compatibility checks
... are there native XPath tools?  I only see Perl/Java impls

Improved error handling for 500, at least send back the redis
error code

Determine if need to detect proxy use in request ... will Apache
fork() an API process if request has full URI?

handle error from fread

todo text should be entity-escaped in output ... < -> &lt;

failures should have friendly accompanying messages

add API version info to / also, or perhaps to every XHTML response

Add feature test macros

/ contains link to source on github, for Affero compliance

Improve README for general consumption

ensure_redis_connection should fail_with_code

Add todo-id attribute to output XHTML
